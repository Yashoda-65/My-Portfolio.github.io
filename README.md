Concerning website structure To develop my website and link it to the database through a server, I utilized html, css, javascript, and php.

Database information to link my database to my website, I utilized xampp server. In PhpMyAdmin on the xampp server, I established my database.One table was made specifically to collect information from the fans. Name and email number are included.The database will add those facts to the table when you complete the form.

This is a localhost server, thus installing it on your device is required before you can use the localhost address to access a website and check the database.
